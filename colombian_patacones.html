<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Patacones are a popular dish throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, made from green plantains. The Colombian version involves twice-frying the plantain slices, first to soften them and then to get them crispy and golden brown. They are typically served as an appetizer or a side dish.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2-3 green plantains</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>(Optional) Garlic powder or other seasonings</li>    
</ul>

<h3>How to prepare?</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Peel the plantains: Using a sharp knife, carefully slice off the ends of the plantains. Make a shallow cut along the length of the plantain peel. Use your fingers or the knife to pry the peel away from the plantain.</li>
    <li>First fry: Slice the peeled plantains into thick, 1-inch (2.5 cm) rounds. Heat about an inch of vegetable oil in a deep skillet or pot to medium-high heat. Carefully place the plantain slices in the hot oil. Fry them for about 2-3 minutes on each side, until they are golden but not yet crispy. They should be soft enough to flatten.</li>
    <li>Flatten the plantains: Remove the plantains from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. While they are still warm, use a "pataconera" (a special press) or the bottom of a heavy, flat object like a glass or a small plate to flatten each plantain slice into a thin disk. Be careful as they can still be hot.</li>
    <li>Second fry: Return the flattened plantains to the hot oil. This time, fry them until they are golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes on each side.</li>
    <li>Season and serve: Remove the crispy patacones from the oil and place them on a paper towel to drain. Immediately sprinkle them generously with salt and any other desired seasonings. Serve warm with "hogao" (a Colombian tomato and onion sauce), guacamole, or "suero coste√±o" (a tangy sour cream-like sauce).</li>
</ol>
