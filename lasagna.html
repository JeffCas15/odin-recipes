<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of layers of pasta sheets, meat or vegetable sauce, and a creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese sauce. It's a comforting, hearty baked dish that is a staple in Italian cuisine worldwide.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 box of lasagna noodles (about 12-16 noodles)</li>
    <li>1.5 pounds of ground beef or a mix of beef and pork</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>3-4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 (28-ounce) cans of crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of dried basil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of dried basil</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 large container of ricotta cheese (15 ounces)</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Olive oil for cooking</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to prepare?</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Prepare the meat sauce: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat a little olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground meat and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it's browned. Drain any excess fat. Add the chopped onion and cook until it softens. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for about a minute until fragrant. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, and let it simmer for at least 30 minutes, or up to an hour, for a richer flavor.</li>
    <li>Cook the noodles: While the sauce simmers, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package directions. Drain them and lay them flat on a baking sheet to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
    <li>Prepare the cheese filling: In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the Parmesan cheese. Season with a little salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Assemble the lasagna: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the dish. Arrange a single layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread about one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles. Sprinkle with some of the mozzarella cheese. Add another layer of noodles, followed by more meat sauce, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella. Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of noodles topped with the remaining meat sauce, the rest of the mozzarella, and the remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake: Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Uncover and bake for another 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the sauce is hot. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving to allow it to set.</li>
